  /* A few media query to set some font sizes at different screen sizes.
   * This helps automate a bit of responsiveness.
   * The trick is to use the rem unit for size values, margin and padding.
   * Because rem is relative to the document font size
   * when we scale up or down the font size on the document
   * it will affect all properties using rem units for the values.
